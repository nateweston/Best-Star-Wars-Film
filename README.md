# Best-Star-Wars-Film
I examine data from a Star Wars survey done by FiveThirtyEight with 835 respondents.

The survey was completed before the release of Episode VII: The Force Awakens.

The question being explored is which Star Wars film is considered to be the best.

I examine how different segments of the survey population answer the question, focusing specifically on men vs women, Star Wars fans vs non-fans, and Star Trek fans vs non-fans.
